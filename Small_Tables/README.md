## SQL_Practice

### Following are the steps to set up you workspace</br>
1)  #### [**Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)<br>
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.
SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL Server and databases. Use SSMS to deploy, monitor, and upgrade 
the data-tier components used by your applications, and build queries and scripts.</br>
Use SSMS to query, design, and manage your databases and data warehouses, wherever they are - on your local computer, or in the cloud.

2) #### [**Download SQL Server**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)</br>
Download a free specialized edition, I have downloaded</br>
**Express version** - SQL Server 2019 Express is a free edition of SQL Server, ideal for development and production for desktop, web, and small server applications.

3) Open SSMS connect with the SQL Server ---> Create Database ---> Create Tables</Br>
Good to go now for practice.

Before using any Scripts, need to create the **Table**</br>
use the [Create.sql](https://github.com/Bluelord/SQL_Practice/blob/435c68977ee04512c73bc13a869ea83ab8bc405c/SQL%20Create%20Query.sql) to create a table in the database,</br>
then we can exicute any query in any perticular order.</br>
If there is an error due to database name, please change the script according the the name you set for the database.
